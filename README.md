My projects name is "Universal Vs. Disney quiz". The website provides the user with questions to determine if they should go to Disneyland or Universal Studios. I made this project after being struggling to decide if I should go to Universal Studios 
or Disneyland with my family next summer, and thought to create this website as a submission. 
This was heavily made through Javascript, with some decorating from CSS. HTML is used to tie everything together and make it accessible to users. I spent most of my time figuring out how to include a pop up, as that was the first time 
I ever coded a popup. I also had to spend some time figuring out how to get the quiz to restart. I struggled with both of these buttons, and heavily learned more about how HTML
works with JavaScript to create interactivity. Things such as updating the website based on user input may seem complex, but is simple when logically thinking about it.
